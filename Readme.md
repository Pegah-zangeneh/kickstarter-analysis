### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on Launch Date, The most successful campaigns were launched in May and June and the outcome falls towards the end of year.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Campaigns with smaller Goal amount were more successfull than others with larger Goal. Campaigns with the goal over 20000$ failed more.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Using COUNTIFS() was challenging for me when I was trying to check my result. I realized the Row title of Subcategory was changed in the formula and when I edit it, problem solved.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
It is not a good idea for campaigns to Launch around end of the year. The most successful ones start in May!
